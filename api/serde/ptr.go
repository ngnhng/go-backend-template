// Helper to address the UnaddressableOperand issue.
//
// An expression is addressable if it denotes a specific, stable storage location in memory.
// A function's result is a rvalue and Go distinguishes between value (rvalue) and variable.
//
// In Go, values (rvalues) may exists only transiently (in registers, on stack or be optimized away) so they are not addressable.
// Allowing rvalue addressability would complicate lifetime semantics and disallow some optimizations.
//
// Ptr returns &v, which basically allocates a cell for the value v (allocate the literal and return its pointer).
func Ptr[T any](v T) *T {
	return &v
}
